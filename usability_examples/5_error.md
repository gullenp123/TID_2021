# Error prevention

Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

## Examples

### Gustav
For the burners, if they do not ignite the user have to manually find the error. It could be that the burner is not located directly over the gas outlet. However, there are no indication of such. But, an important feature for this stove, is that it does not allow the gas outlet to let out gas without the knob being pressed in whilst igniting the gas. This is a critical feature, as in  worse case the stove can cause a fire. The simplistic design, whilst limiting usefullness it also minimize the risk of setting the oven in an incorrect state as this simply isn't possible.
