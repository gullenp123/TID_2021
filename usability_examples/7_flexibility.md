# Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

## Examples

### Gustav
As the neither of the knobs on the stove indicate which way to turn them (counter-clockwise) the user might need to use the oven a couple of times before they become an "expert". As the functionality of the object is low it doesn't take long for a user to be comfortable with the stove. There are no apperent accelerators.
