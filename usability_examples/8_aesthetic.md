# Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

## Examples

### Gustav
The design is minimastic as it doesn't convey any non-essential information. It only shows which knob turns on the respective burner and the temperature which the stove is at (the low visibility of temperature is due to wear and tear).
