# Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

## Examples

### Gustav
Due to the simplistic and old design the stove doesn't mediate any error messages, which can prove to be annoying to the user if the burner or stove doesn't work. However, as minimal electronic components exists in this design there are also less things that can break. Therefore, if a error occours it is relatively easy to find it and fix it.
