# Help and documentation

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the userâ€™s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

## Examples

### Gustav
The only documentation for the stove/oven is the visual symbols at the front. It can be argued that this is enough due to the simplistic design. However, if something break internally in the stove the user will either need to have knowledge of how to fix ancient stoves or call a technichian to help troubleshoot the stove and fix the error.
