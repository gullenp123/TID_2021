# User control and freedom

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

## Examples

### Gustav
With the simplistic design of the oven there isn't really any reason to undo mistakes. However, if a user accidently makes the oven too hot they will have to let it cool before cooking whatever foodstuff needs cooking. The undo function is (due to thermo-dynamics) therefore, slow and cumbersome, although possible by turning the knob in the opposite direction.
